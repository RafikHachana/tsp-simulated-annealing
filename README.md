# TSP solution with Simulated Annealing
This repo contains a heuristic solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem using the Simulated Annealing algorithm.

All the used Python code is in the `main.ipynb`. The implementation solves the problem for the top 30 most populous Russian cities, and generates a visualization of the algorithm. We also try different cooling speeds for the temperature in the Simulated Annealing algorithm.

An example visualization is also provided in this repo (`animation.mp4`).
